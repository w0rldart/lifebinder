# Note: Life Binder is a local-first application that stores all data
# in the browser's IndexedDB. No backend database or API keys are required.
# The application runs entirely client-side after the initial page load.

# If you plan to extend Life Binder with backend features in the future,
# you can add environment variables here. Currently, no environment
# variables are required for the application to function.
