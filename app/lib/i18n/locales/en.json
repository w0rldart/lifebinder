        "multipleDevicesA": "Life Binder stores data locally per device. To sync across devices, export from one device and import to another, or use cloud storage for your exported backups.",
        "legallyBindingQ": "Is Life Binder legally binding?",
        "legallyBindingA": "No. Life Binder is a personal organizational tool, not a legal document. Always work with an attorney for legally binding wills, trusts, and estate documents.",
        "clearBrowserQ": "What if I clear my browser data?",
        "clearBrowserA": "If you clear browser storage, your Life Binder data will be deleted. This is why regular encrypted exports are crucial - they allow you to restore your data.",
        "passwordsQ": "Should I include actual passwords?",

        "percentageQ": "How do I know what percentage complete is \"enough\"?",

        "customizeQ": "Can I customize categories or add custom fields?",
        "customizeA": "Currently, Life Binder has fixed categories, but most sections have notes fields for additional information. Use these for custom details that don't fit standard fields.",
